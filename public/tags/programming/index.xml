      <title>The Obligation of The Programmer</title>

      <description>Robert C.Martin, of Clean Code fame, has something to say on the role of we programmers in today&amp;#8217;s society.
 We rule the world.
We don&amp;#8217;t quite understand this yet. More importantly, the world doesn&amp;#8217;t quite understand it yet. Our civilization doesn&amp;#8217;t quite realize how dependent it has become on software &amp;#8212; on us.
 He goes as far as suggesting a programmer&amp;#8217;s code of conduct of sorts. Food for thought I guess, although I suspect we&amp;#8217;re too much of a wild and scattered bunch for something like that to really stick.</description>

      <description>This originally appeared on Quora and is well worth reading.
 Becoming a good programmer is incredibly difficult and it doesn’t happen quickly. We can’t expect to plant some trees and have 2000-year-old redwoods grow overnight, regardless of the demand for them.

      <description>But here’s the rub. Programming, like writing, painting, and music, is chiefly a creative endeavor not a technical one. Practice with any technology or language is useful as a means of learning tools and techniques, but it will not make you a substantially better programmer.
